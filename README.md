# 12th-CoronaBatch-Mark-Calculation-2021

`Just a Simple Program.`
As you all know 12th std students batch of 2021 doesn't have a public exam due to the covid pandemic, by the result of this all exams are cancelled and this public exam too..
so as per the government regulation they have announced a mark criteria for 12th students on the basis of how they will calculate the marks, even without writing the exam,
By Analysing the 10th,11th,and 12th(practical only) ,they have calculated and published the results on JULY 19 and 5 days before the result date they have announced this plan with the mark calcultion formula.
So I've made a python program on july 15, which gives the accurate mark of 12th std by feeding the 10th,11th, and 12th marks.

`Formula for this calculation : (50% of 10th Public marks)   +   (20% of 11th Public Marks)   +   (30% of 12th Practical Only).`
